# galaxy-shooter-ml
This is galaxy shooter version that includes machine learning for the game. For the base game check out [the master branch](https://github.com/MaciejWanat/galaxy-shooter-ml/tree/master).

This is heavily modded version, adjusted for the machine learning purposes. It's based on neural networks. Currently goal realized by program is shooting the enemies approaching. Power-ups and raising difficulty are disabled.

If you are interested in older version with different goals, look throught past commits:
- e5452ff - avoiding collisions with enemy (respawned enemy)
